title: "Building a Sales Intelligence Pipeline: From Raw Data to OLTP ETL to
  Data Insights"
excerpt: This case study follows the complete journey of transforming raw sales
  data into actionable business insights. It covers ETL for OLTP modeling in
  PostgreSQL, data cleaning in Python, and sales performance analytics to
  support data-driven decisions for product, region, and customer strategies.

# This project documents a complete data workflow for RetailX â€” from structured ETL design to insight generation:

## ðŸ”§ ETL & OLTP Design

This project began by ingesting raw sales data and transforming it into a structured format. Below is a snippet of how data cleaning was performed using pandas:

\- Data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas`

````markdown
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("sales_dataset.csv")
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.lower().str.replace(" ", "_")
df["order_date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["order_date"], errors="coerce")
df = df.drop_duplicates().dropna(subset=["order_id", "order_date"])
df["cost"] = df["amount"] - df["profit"]
```
````

\- Postgresql table creation and secure data loading using `psycopg2`

> Next, I connected to Postgresql and created the OLTP schema skipping 3NF (Assumption:Table is normlised):

\- Validation of load and schema integrity

## ðŸ“Š Sales Analysis

With the cleaned data loaded into Postgresql, I explored:

\- **Top-Selling Products**: `Tables` lead in quantity; `Markers` in revenue

````markdown
**Example: Top 5 selling products by quantity**
```sql
SELECT sub_category, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM retailx_oltp.orders
GROUP BY sub_category
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
````

\- **Regional Insights**: High sales from `New York`, `Florida`, and `California`; `Orlando` leads city-wise

\- **Customer Value**: High spenders like `Cory Evans` and recurring buyers like `Scott Lewis`

\- **Seasonal Trends**: Revenue peaks in `May` and `December`, with `December 2022` hitting **Â£204,413**

\- **Payment Patterns**: `Debit Card` is the most used payment method

This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline tailored for retail sales intelligence. It covers the full lifecycle from raw CSV ingestion, data cleaning, to structured loading in Postgresql. The process culminates in a suite of analytical queries and visualisations designed to extract actionable insights.

By combining data engineering best practices with business-focused analysis, the notebook serves as a blueprint for building scalable, insight-driven workflows. It is especially valuable for data engineers, analysts, and BI practitioners aiming to bridge the gap between backend data modelling and front-end decision support.

## Restoring the Postgresql Database from a \`.backup\` File

````markdown
To restore the `.backup` file (custom format), ensure:

- PostgreSQL is installed and running
- The `pg_restore` tool is available in your terminal
- You know the PostgreSQL username (postgres) and have appropriate access

```bash
pg_restore -U your_user -C -d postgres retailx_backup_2024_04_17.backup
